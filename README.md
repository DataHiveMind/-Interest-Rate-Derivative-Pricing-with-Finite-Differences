# -Interest-Rate-Derivative-Pricing-with-Finite-Differences

Objective: Build a program to price interest rate derivatives using finite difference methods.

Approach:

1. Learn about finite difference methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).

2. Understand the PDEs governing the pricing of interest rate derivatives like swaps and options.

3. Develop a program that implements the finite difference method to solve the relevant PDEs for various derivative specifications.

4. Compare the model's outputs with market prices for validation.
